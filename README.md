# Keyherald
Keyherald is a python scipt that captures the keystrokes system wide and broadcasts them to the windows of your choice.
Imagine pressing the right button and having it redirected to all the open Image Viewers.

# Dependencies

 - Python Keyboard Library
 - Root User Permission
 - Xdotool (And thus Linux)

# Usage
sudo python keyherald

# Future Work
Recently discovered that this doesn't work the vnc viewers. Would be adding a fix for the same.
